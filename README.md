 Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis

 Project Description: This project focuses on utilizing a deep learning model for the classification of brain tumors, aiding the healthcare sector in the early detection and classification of tumors to save patients' lives. By leveraging advanced techniques, this project aims to make the analysis of brain tumor images faster and more efficient.

Objective: The primary goal is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify brain tumors into four types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. This classification is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning, improving patient outcomes.

Methodology: Our approach is based on a review of research from the paper “A Review on Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis”. This research helped us identify the most suitable models for medical image classification. We chose to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), known for its effectiveness in image processing tasks. CNNs provide efficient and rapid classification, making them ideal for this medical application.

Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing MRI scans of human brains, which includes images labeled as glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. This dataset provides a foundation for training and testing the CNN model to classify these types accurately.
